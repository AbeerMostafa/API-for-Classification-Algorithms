# API-for-Classification-Algorithms
This project preprocesses the provided dataset (feature selection, fillna, labelEncoding, Standerdization)  then implements various algorithms for classification (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest), puts them all together using a flask API to choose one of the algorithms, train the model, then test your own data.

- Install flask, sklearn, numpy and pandas.
- Run from terminal: python ml_api.py
- open your browser to the address (http://127.0.0.1:5000/) -> "localhost:5000"
